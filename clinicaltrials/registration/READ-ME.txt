This is a copy of django-registration changeset d36a38202ee3 [1]

[1] http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/changeset/d36a38202ee3/

It was obtained doing wget on URL [2] on 2010-03-23

[2] http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/get/tip.zip

From the zip above the registration/ subdir was extracted and this readme added.

Previously I tried to do a regular install but successive import errors trying to use the default backend convinced me that the documented installation procedure does not work at this time. (LR)
