The balloon is then inflated, compressing the plaque and dilating (widening) the narrowed coronary artery so that blood can flow more easily. During PCI for this study, the BVS EECSS is then placed in the coronary artery to support the previously narrowed area. The BVS EECSS will remain in place until the bioabsorbtion process is complete, your physician will discuss this process with you. The duration of the PCI procedure will depend on many factors, and is typically less than 2 hours.
